> Particle Build (Online)
> > The Particle Build IDE is an always-online, browser-based portal where your Photon code can be edited, saved, and shared. This cloud-based IDE handles code compilation and flashes the built binaries to your Photon over-the-air. You don’t even need your Photon next to you to update its program!

> Particle Dev (Half-Online, Half Offline)
> > If you’re uneasy about leaving your hard work in the mysterious “cloud,” but still want all of the benefits offered by Particle Build, Particle Dev is a great middle-of-the-road option. For the most part Particle Dev is still an online IDE. Your code is stored locally, but the “cloud” is still required to compile. You’ll need to be connected to the Internet to get the full use out of it.
> > Particle Dev, a professional IDE for Particle based on Github's Atom project


> ARM GCC and the DFU Bootloader (Offline)
> > At its heart, the Photon is just an STM32F205 ARM processor with a Broadcom WiFi chip built in. Developing firmware for it doesn’t have to be different from any other ARM processor. Plus, because the Photon is completely open source, you have access to all of the firmware to help get you started.

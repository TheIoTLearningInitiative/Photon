Introduction
==

> Particle (formerly Spark), an open source hardware/software platform for the Internet of Things. A prototype-to-production platform for developing an Internet of Things product.

> Prototyping tools for the Internet of Things
> > Our hardware development kits give you a microcontroller and connectivity (Wi-Fi or cellular) along with powerful software development tools and a cloud back-end. Add the internet to your product with a single line of code.

> Scaling with Particle
> > Particle's Internet of Things platform is designed to help you whether you're building your first prototype or manufacturing at scale. Here's how easy it is to scale your IoT product with Particle.

> Manage your connected "fleet"
> > Close the feedback loop. Particle's Device Management tools help you fix problems in the field, generate valuable customer insights, and improve the quality and experience of your products over time.
